## Overview

This project implements some basic functions to work with hypercompositional structures. In particualre we include:

- **Hyperoperation**: Defines a binary operation on a set H.
- **Associativity Check**: Verifies if a hyperoperation is associative.
- **Reprocudtivity Check**: Verifies if a hyperoperation is associative.
- **Weak Associativity Check**: Verifies if a hyperoperation is weakly associative.
- **Identity Elements**: Identifies identities in a hypercompositional structure, including partial identities.
- **$\beta$ relation and transitive closure**: Computes the beta relation of a hypergroupoid.
- **Fundamental group and heart**

The primary focus is the computation of the heart of Hv-group and hypergroup.
